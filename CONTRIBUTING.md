Hey there bud! 

This is my very first NPM library built with Angular, I'm still no expert yet :) I'm open to suggestions on how we can make the library more robust so that users may depend on it :)

I'm very excited to know about what you think!

This library is built using [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and packaged using [ng-packagr](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr) by [David Herges](https://github.com/dherges/).
